# Techechelons_Project

I have done the coding as per requirement. Although my concentration went on coding for first task did not give much importance to styling but my second task I used meida queries and styling using pure css.

In task one for sorting when you mouse over table header I have not added any chevron's, but I made sure that the cursor pointer changes when mousing over those particular fields.

I request you to use and IDE or use node http-server for running the project.

I have added comments to make my code more understandable.

I have implemented using callbacks and did not use any javascript pattern because this is the first time I had to code an application completely using Javascript. To be honest I am not much aware of "Javascript Patterns".

I have added an navigation from task 1 to task 2. There is a hyperlink named AboutUs at the bottom of the page. You can resize the window and see the effects of aboutus page.
